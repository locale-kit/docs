# Borders
Most of the parameter types that are bordered (i.e. strings, keys, and functions) can be customised for either ease of reading/comprehension, or to make nesting easier without having to [escape](#escaping) border pairs. The borders can be any of the following pairs (start border, end border):
- `'`, `'`
- `"`, `"`
- `\`, \``
- `[`, `]`
- `(`, `)`
- `{`, `}`

# Escaping
When you need to nest a character that matches the border but don't want it to count as the end of the string, you can escape it with a backslash. A backslash on its own will get removed, so you'll need to escape that too. For example, to include a `"` in a string that uses `"` as its border, you would write `\"`. To include a literal backslash in a string, you'd use a double backslash: `\\`.
Due to the way strings are handled in JS/TS, you pretty much have to double up backslashes to have them be in the string. So the above become: `\\"` and `\\\\`.
